== MirageOS Unikernels

MirageOS unikernels are written in OCaml and can be run directly on top of Muen
via the https://github.com/solo5/solo5/[Solo5] platform. Support for Muen was
merged into Solo5 with https://github.com/Solo5/solo5/pull/190[pull-request
#190] and is part of the official Mirage release since version 3.5.0. The port
includes an implementation of `muennet`, thus networking is supported.

=== Muen Version
The instructions in this article have been tested with Muen revision `1cd1f88`.

=== Unikernel Build
MirageOS heavily depends on the OCaml Package Manager
(http://opam.ocaml.org/[OPAM]) as its build system. Follow the installation
instructions https://mirage.io/wiki/install[here] to setup OPAM on your system.
However, do not yet install `mirage` until after the next step.

==== Docker
We provide ready-made Docker images containing all required software to build
Muen system images and MirageOS unikernels. Issue the following command to get
the Muen Development environment:

  $ docker pull ghcr.io/codelabs-ch/muen-dev-env

By default, the commands given in this article are expected to be run in the
`muen-dev-env` container. You can use the run script provided as part of the
Muen repository to enter the container like so:

  $ tools/docker/run.muen-dev-env ghcr.io/codelabs-ch/muen-dev-env \
	  EXTRA_EXPOSE="--expose 4433"

The `EXTRA_EXPOSE` environment variable makes sure that port 4433 is accessible
from outside of the container. It is required for accessing the website served
by the `static_website_tls` unikernel as described in section "Serving Static
Website".

For building MirageOS unikernels, there is a separate image, which you can
acquire by issuing the following command:

  $ docker pull ghcr.io/codelabs-ch/muen-mirageos

This container is only used for building unikernels and it is explicitly stated
in this article when commands should be executed in the `muen-mirageos`
container.

If you use Docker to build the unikernels and Muen system images, you can skip
the rest of this section and continue reading at "Running unikernels".

==== OCaml Compiler
These instructions have been tested with version 4.14.1 of the compiler. If you
are not already using this compiler, you can create a new switch as follows:

  $ opam switch create 4.14.1

Then make sure you update the environment:

  $ eval $(opam env --switch=4.14.1)

The version 4.14.1 should be marked as the current version:

  $ opam switch list
  ...
  #   switch  compiler                    description
  ->  4.14.1  ocaml-base-compiler.4.14.1  4.14.1
  ...

Update the Opam repository to the latest state:

  $ opam update
  $ opam upgrade

==== Mirage Tool
These instructions have been tested with MirageOS version 4.4.0. Install the
mirage tool:

  $ opam install -y mirage.4.4.0

==== Solo5 ELF tool
Since version v0.6.0, Solo5 unikernels contain a so called "application
manifest", which enables support for multiple network and block devices. In
order to query this information the `solo5-elftool` needs to be installed. For
that purpose, download Solo5 and install the tool like so:

  $ wget https://github.com/Solo5/solo5/releases/download/v0.8.0/solo5-v0.8.0.tar.gz
  $ tar -zxf solo5-v0.8.0.tar.gz
  $ cd solo5-v0.8.0
  $ ./configure.sh --only-tools
  $ make install-tools

By default, the tools are made accessible by installing them in
`/usr/local/bin`. You can change the destination directory via the `DESTDIR`
environment variable.


=== Running Unikernels
Solo5 comes bundled with simple test cases, most of which can be executed on
Muen in QEMU/KVM. Download Solo5 and build the tests like so:

  $ wget https://github.com/Solo5/solo5/releases/download/v0.8.0/solo5-v0.8.0.tar.gz
  $ tar -zxf solo5-v0.8.0.tar.gz
  $ cd solo5-v0.8.0

NOTE: You only need to download the Solo5 source if you are using the
muen-dev-env Docker container and have not done so in the previous step.

Then, build the tests:

  $ ./configure.sh
  $ make

This should leave you with a Hello World unikernel ready to go, which you can
find at `tests/test_hello/test_hello.muen`. Post-process the compiled binary
with the `solo5-muen-gencspec` script invoking it from the Muen toplevel
directory as follows:

  $ tools/scripts/solo5-muen-gencspec.py [..]/solo5-v0.8.0/tests/test_hello/test_hello.muen \
	  policy/xml/mirageos/cspec_src.xml policy/obj \
	  --out_spec policy/xml/mirageos/component_unikernel.xml \
	  --bootparams "Hi!" --disable-reset

The script generates a Muen component specification for the unikernel and
copies the test_hello.muen binary to the Muen build directory. It is expected
to be found in the `policy/obj` directory when assembling the Muen system image.

NOTE: Boot parameters are optional and can be omitted. Additionally, you can
specify the amount of unikernel RAM via the `--ram` parameter.

Finally, emulate the system:

  $ make SYSTEM=xml/mirage-solo5.xml emulate

The unikernel does not produce any VGA output but you should see the following
messages in the log:

  $ tools/scripts/mulog-filter.py 7 emulate/serial.out


```

```

NOTE: If the following failure pops up, run the `solo5-muen-gencspec.py` script
again in order to (re-)generate the component specification and copy the
unikernel binary to the expected directory: make[1]: *** No rule to make target
'[..]/muen/policy/obj/test_hello.muen'.

=== Serving Static Website
The `mirage-skeleton` https://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton/[repository]
contains example unikernels. One of these examples serves a
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C6wSmDiWoAEQFvx.jpg[static website].

  $ git clone https://github.com/mirage/mirage-skeleton
  $ cd mirage-skeleton/applications/static_website_tls
  $ git checkout 3a955d604d45

NOTE: If you are using Docker containers, execute the above commands in the
`muen-mirageos` container.

NOTE: We checkout a specific revision to make sure we are using a version which
is known to work.

The content that will be served can be found in the `htdocs` directory. You can
replace it with something more interesting, e.g. an article about your successful
adventures with MirageOS and Muen.

Which IP address the unikernel is supposed to use is configured via the
`--ipv4*` options that can either be passed as unikernel configure parameters
or using the `--bootparams` parameter of the `solo5-muen-gencspec.py` script.

To serve the website from 192.168.254.10, build the static_website_tls
unikernel by issuing the following commands:

  $ mirage configure -t muen --ipv4=192.168.254.10/24 --ipv4-gateway=192.168.254.1
  $ make depend
  $ make

NOTE: If you are using Docker containers, execute the above commands in the
`muen-mirageos` container.

If all goes well an unikernel image called `https.muen` should be present in
the current directory.

As before, process the ELF binary using the `solo5-muen-gencspec.py` script:

  $ tools/scripts/solo5-muen-gencspec.py [..]/static_website_tls/https.muen \
	  policy/xml/mirageos/cspec_src.xml policy/obj \
	  --out_spec policy/xml/mirageos/component_unikernel.xml

The unikernel serves the website via https on port 4433. Since we are using
QEMU's host forwarding to expose networking of the emulated system to the host,
we must forward this port by setting the `QEMU_NETDEV_EXTRA_OPTS` environment
variable:

  $ export QEMU_NETDEV_EXTRA_OPTS="hostfwd=tcp::4433-192.168.254.10:4433"

NOTE: Make sure to use the same IP address that you specified in the mirage
configure step.

Now once more build and emulate the system:

  $ make SYSTEM=xml/mirage-solo5.xml emulate

Since system startup time varies, you can check the log file to make sure
networking is up and ready:

  $ tools/scripts/mulog-filter.py 2 emulate/serial.out | grep "Interface"


```
[    6.339000] net0: Interface added
[    6.339000] service: Interface added

```

Finally, you can point your browser to `https://localhost:4433/` and after
accepting the certificate warnings you should see the static website served by
MirageOS. Congratulations, you have just successfully served yourself a website
via a MirageOS unikernel running on Muen!

NOTE: When deploying the system to hardware you must direct your browser to the
IP address, which was used to configure the unikernel, e.g.
`https://192.168.254.10:4433/`.
